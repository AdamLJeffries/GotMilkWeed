# GotMilkWeed 
GotMilkweed is a program I wrote to help identify types of milkweed varieties by location and to assist gardeners on which to plant, as not to interupt Monarch butterfly migrations. It will also indicate toxicity. The application uses CRUD API and also in memory API and operates asyncronously. It also uses a dictionary. I'm still refining mycode to ensure meaningful use.
From starting of the program, swagger will initialize. Next you can try it out, and execute. It will list the varieties to North America and wether toxic. With CRUD you can ADD, post, and Delete from the database the different varieties. The target use for the API is to help gardeners plant the variety of milkweed to their garden that will not be toxic to Monarch butterflies nor affect their migration.
