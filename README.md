# GotMilkWeed 
GotMilkweed is a program I wrote to help identify types of milkweed varieties by location and to assist gardeners on which to plant, as not to interupt Monarch butterfly migrations. It will also indicate toxicity. The application uses CRUD API and also in memory API and operates asyncronously. It also uses a dictionary. I'm still refining mycode to ensure meaningful use.
